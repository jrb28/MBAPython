This repository contains the materials for a two-hour session I do on introductory Python with the Raymond A. Mason School of Business MBA students.  Besides a PowerPoint presentation, the main contents include a Jupyter notebook and the image and data files that are referenced by the Jupyter notebook.

To install these files for the session, please follow the directions in the install.md file.
